<p>For my image, I mainly focused on meeting the initial criteria for the assignment while also completing the assignment in a timely manner. I tried to incorporate some typography into the mix with multiple fonts that I thought complimented each other and the complimentary colors used (Green/Red, and Orange/Blue) which I thought went well coincidentally. Through the red, I also attempted to give off the appearance of bloodshotness but I’m not sure if that fully got through. I also added a downwards angled line to make the eye appear angry which I labeled as “angry” above it. I also added the word tear below the eye (where a teardrop would normally be placed) and changed the font to script for aesthetic purposes.
